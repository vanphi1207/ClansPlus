## API Usage

Setting up maven:

```maven
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```

```maven
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.CortezRomeo</groupId>
	    <artifactId>ClansPlus</artifactId>
	    <version><VERSION></version>
	</dependency>
```

Checking if ClanPlus in on the server:

```java

@Override
public void onEnable() {
    if (Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("ClansPlus") == null) {
        getLogger().severe("ClansPlus is not in the server!");
        Bukkit.getPluginManager().disablePlugin(this);
        return;
    }
}
```

Initializing ClansPlus's API:

```java
ClanPlus clansPlusAPI = Bukkit.getServicesManager().getRegistration(ClanPlus.class).getProvider();
```

Example of using the API:

```java
// Initialize plugin API.
ClanPlus clansPlusAPI = Bukkit.getServicesManager().getRegistration(ClanPlus.class).getProvider();

// Get clan name and clan data.
String clanName = "HelloClan";

// If clan does not exist, create a new clan.
if(!clansPlusAPI.getPluginDataManager().getClanDatabase().containsKey(clanName))
        clansPlusAPI.getPluginDataManager().

loadClanDatabase(clanName);

IClanData clanData = clanPlusAPI.getPluginDataManager().getClanDatabase(clanName);

// Add a player to a clan.
String playerName = "Cortez_Romeo";
clansPlusAPI.getClanManager().addPlayerToAClan(playerName, clanName, false);

// Promote this player to leader of the clan.
clansPlusAPI.getPluginDataManager().getPlayerDatabase(playerName).setRank(Rank.LEADER);
clanData.setOwner(playerName);

// Adjust clan's database
clanData.setMessage("This is the first message of this clan!");
clanData.setCustomName("&bSuper Clan");

// One of the stuffs you can do with clan manager.
clansPlusAPI.getClanManager().alertClan(clanName, "Have a good day!");

// Save database
clansPlusAPI.getPluginDataManager().saveClanDatabaseToStorage(clanName, clanData);
```
